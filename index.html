      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>
        My project explores how music functions as a transformative force that forges social bonds across diverse cultures. In an increasingly fragmented world, music serves not only as entertainment but also as a powerful tool to foster empathy and build community.

      <h2>Case Studies & Evidence</h2>
      <p>
        Through a blend of archival research and contemporary case studies, the project analyzes communal music practices in traditional societies alongside the evolution of digital musical engagement. By comparing these diverse contexts, I aim to reveal the universal aspects of music that transcend cultural boundaries.
