          <p>Hello, this is Aaron Zhou, and I’m checking in at the midpoint of my “Music and Human Connection” project. I’d like to walk you through what I’ve accomplished so far and how my research has evolved.

            At the very start, I zeroed in on the piano as a symbol of togetherness. I wanted to understand how a single instrument could bring people together, so I began with three vivid examples. First, I read the 1949 Lantern article about Ohio State University receiving a grand piano. That story showed how students gathered around that piano—playing duets, rehearsing for performances, and striking up conversations in practice rooms. It illustrated how one gift of music created a new community space.
            
            Next, I explored Abraham Santos Fernández’s narrative in the Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives, titled “How Music Taught Me to Listen.” In his story, Fernández talks about learning piano as a journey toward deeper empathy. He describes how mastering scales and chords sharpened his ability to listen—to the music, to other musicians, and to the emotions around him. That personal account made it clear that the piano isn’t just an instrument; it’s a mirror for human connection.
            
            Then, I examined a playful comic from the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library showing a couple kissing atop a piano. In two simple panels, the artists captured how playing the piano side by side can spark intimacy. That image, though humorous, confirmed my sense that the piano functions as a platform for shared experience—where musical collaboration blends into personal bonds.
            
            Once I felt confident about the piano’s role, I stepped back to look at music more broadly. I dove into Tom A. Garner’s How the World Listens. Garner’s fieldwork across continents—from public drumming ceremonies in West Africa to street performers in Buenos Aires—revealed that music, in any form, binds communities. I saw how people dancing together in Shanghai’s parks or gathering for impromptu jam sessions in Berlin all tap into that universal language of rhythm and melody.
            
            To deepen my perspective, I then evaluated several key scholarly works. The Handbook of Music Therapy opened my eyes to therapeutic music sessions that help individuals overcome emotional and communicative barriers. Next, I reviewed Katelin Webster’s study of intercultural music-making among Syrian refugees in northern Germany—how collaborative performances served as a bridge for cultural integration and healing. Finally, I read Tiziano Bonini and Paolo Magaudda’s Platformed!, which examines how streaming algorithms and AI-driven playlists on platforms like Spotify and YouTube shape collective listening habits. Together, these sources confirmed that music’s connective power spans clinical settings, refugee communities, and digital networks alike.
            
            With all that background, I drafted my formal project proposal. I defined my central question—How do shared musical experiences create collective belonging in a digitally isolated society?—and outlined my methods: archival analysis, literature synthesis, and multimedia case studies. Writing the proposal helped me crystallize my timeline and key milestones.
            
            Next, I researched faculty at OSU whose work aligns with mine. I crafted a letter of introduction to Professor Ryan Skinner in the School of Music, explaining how my findings on piano symbolism, music therapy, and algorithmic listening could complement his ethnomusicology research. That exercise sharpened my ability to communicate the broader relevance of my project.
            
            Finally, I began composing the literature review itself. I’m weaving together the piano-focused case studies, Garner’s global insights, and the therapeutic, refugee-integration, and streaming perspectives. So far, I’m synthesizing these threads to demonstrate that music—whether acoustic or digital, intimate or communal—acts as a dynamic social force.
            
            Looking ahead, I’ll continue fleshing out this review, integrate any remaining case studies, and start drafting my analysis chapters. I’m excited by how far the project has come: from a narrow focus on the piano to a panoramic view of music’s role in connecting people across cultures, contexts, and technologies. Thank you for listening to this update, and I look forward to sharing the next stages of my work.</p>

        <div class="transcript-content">
          <p>Hello, this is Aaron Zhou, and I’m reflecting on the completion of my literature review for “Music and Human Connection.” Now that I’ve finished writing the review and synthesized all my research findings, I want to take a step back and reflect on what this process has meant for me, both in terms of intellectual growth and personal insights.

            When I first started this project, I thought I had a clear vision of what I was researching—the piano as a symbol of human connection. I wanted to explore how this instrument could bring people together. As I began to dive into the literature, I quickly realized that the scope of my project was much broader than I initially imagined. The more I researched, the more I felt my perspective shifting, and I had to adapt my approach.
            
            The literature review was a turning point in this process. Up until then, I had focused on specific case studies and stories, like the personal narrative of Abraham Santos Fernández and the Lantern article about the piano donation at OSU. These early sources were fascinating, but they didn’t give me the full picture. Once I started incorporating larger academic works, like Tom A. Garner’s How the World Listens and The Handbook of Music Therapy, I felt my understanding of music’s role in human connection expand exponentially. I realized how music is not just an individual experience but a universal language that fosters community and helps break down barriers.
            
            Reflecting on that realization, it was kind of humbling. Initially, I thought I was just exploring the piano as a personal, intimate instrument, but the deeper I went, the more I understood that music in all its forms—whether it’s traditional, therapeutic, or digital—serves as a much larger social force. It was a bit overwhelming, but it felt like the research was coming together in a way that challenged my initial assumptions. This shift from focusing on one instrument to looking at the broad spectrum of music’s role in society was a major intellectual leap for me. It made me rethink how I define music’s purpose and its role in the modern world.
            
            What I found particularly rewarding during the review process was how the pieces of my research started fitting together. For instance, when I connected the therapeutic applications of music with digital platforms, it clicked that music's role as a connector is both timeless and timely. On one hand, music has always been about fostering empathy and community, as seen in the traditional and therapeutic contexts I explored. On the other hand, the rise of digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube is giving music an entirely new dimension—connecting people across the world, across cultures, and even across different social or emotional states. That realization helped me feel like I was contributing something meaningful to the conversation about the evolving role of music.
            
            On a more personal level, I also found myself grappling with how to frame my research in an accessible way. As someone studying Computer Science and Engineering, I often approach projects with a highly technical mindset. The challenge in this project was to communicate abstract concepts—like how music fosters connection—in a way that’s relatable to a wide audience. The literature review helped me find a balance between my technical perspective and the more human-centered aspects of my research. It was a struggle at times, but I think I’ve grown through it. Writing the review forced me to think more critically about how to weave together different disciplines—humanities and technology—into a cohesive narrative.
            
            As I wrapped up the review, I also found myself reflecting on how much I’ve learned not only about the academic aspects of music but also about the process of research itself. At the beginning, I felt a bit uncertain about how to approach such a large and complex topic, but now I feel much more confident in how to break down a subject, synthesize information, and draw connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. This experience has definitely strengthened my research and writing skills, and I’m proud of how I’ve developed as both a researcher and a writer throughout this process.
            
            Looking forward, I’m excited to move on to the next phase of my project: creating my research poster. </p>

        <div class="transcript-content">
          <p>Hello, this is Aaron Zhou, and I’m reflecting on the process of creating the website for my project, “Music and Human Connection.” This phase has been particularly exciting and a bit personal, as I’ve incorporated my background in Computer Science Engineering into the project in a unique, multimodal way.

            When I first wrote the letter to Professor Skinner, asking him to consider my project and how my findings might align with his research, it felt a bit strange. As a Computer Science major, I didn’t feel like I belonged in the music department. I was talking about music—something that seemed outside my usual technical scope—and yet, here I was, writing about the ways music connects people across cultures. The initial discomfort came from the idea of being a "techie" talking to a music professor about an essay I wrote on music. I remember thinking, How can I make this intersection between my major and this topic work? How could I show my interest in music in a way that felt authentic to my field?
            
            That’s when I decided to integrate my Computer Science background into the project—not just as a side element, but as a core part of how I would present my research. I realized that instead of just writing a traditional research paper and creating a static poster, I could take advantage of my web development skills to design an interactive, digital representation of my findings. And so, the idea for my research website was born.
            
            I began by writing the basic structure in HTML, crafting a simple yet effective layout that would feature the core elements of my research: an introduction to the project, a research question, case studies, and the implications of my findings. The challenge, though, was not just in putting together content but in making it dynamic and engaging. This is where I could weave my programming knowledge into the story.
            
            The website features several interactive elements, like a rotating cube in the background, which was inspired by the way music connects in multiple dimensions—across cultures, through time, and through the digital medium. When users move their mouse near the cube, it starts spinning, symbolizing the interconnectedness of music in our global, technology-driven world. I wanted to use this effect to visually convey the central message of my project: music is something that connects us across various realms—both physical and virtual.
            
            Creating this cube animation wasn’t as straightforward as I thought. I spent hours refining the CSS animations to get the right feel—a balance between smooth, responsive interactivity and a clean, minimal design. I used JavaScript to track the user’s mouse movement, triggering changes in the cube’s rotation as they moved across the screen. At first, the cube didn’t behave as expected, but after a few tweaks to the event listeners and animation logic, I finally got it working as I envisioned.
            
            Adding this interactive element felt like the perfect way to marry my technical skills with my research on human connection through music. It was exciting to take something as abstract as the idea of music bridging divides and turn it into something tangible and engaging on a webpage. The process really pushed me to think creatively about how to translate a technical concept into a form that could enhance the emotional and intellectual experience of the viewer.
            
            Of course, the website isn’t just about the rotating cube. I’ve also included audio recordings and transcriptions of my research journal, giving visitors a chance to engage with the project in different ways. I wanted to incorporate multiple forms of media because I believe that the more ways we experience music and human connection—through hearing, seeing, and interacting—the stronger that connection becomes. This was my way of using my technical background to make my research more accessible, while also keeping it in line with the theme of bridging divides.
            
            There were challenges along the way, especially in trying to balance the technical complexity of the website with the clarity and ease of understanding needed for an academic presentation. But overall, creating this site has been an incredibly rewarding process. It allowed me to use my programming skills to bring my research to life in a way that felt both true to my background and meaningful to my project.
            
            Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue developing the website further, refining the design, and adding any last touches that will help present my findings in a clear, visually appealing manner. Creating this website wasn’t just about showing off my technical skills—it was about integrating my technical identity with my passion for understanding the ways music can connect people across the globe. I’m proud of how the project has come together, and I can’t wait to share it with others in a way that goes beyond just words on paper.</p>
